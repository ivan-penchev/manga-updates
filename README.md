# manga-updates

## Add a new series to check for updates
```sh
## make a folder inside the data folder with the title name
mkdir data/one-piece
## copy the title template inside as data.json
cp data/title.json.tpl data/one-piece/data.json 
```
Copy the slug from the url of the series e.g. https://manganel.me/manga/unexpected-accident has the slug of "unexpected-accident" inside the data.json file.
